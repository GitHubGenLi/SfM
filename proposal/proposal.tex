\section{Description of the project}

This project aims to reconstruct a 3D model of an environment using structure
from motion (SfM). A pipeline will be assembled which makes use of depth data
taken from a Kinect \cite{reckerdepth}. Our work is devoted to investigating
how depth information can simplify the scene registration step and improve
accuracy of the final reconstructed model.

\section{Work packages and timeline}

First, a small base dataset will be acquired using a Kinect. A basic pipeline
will be assembled where (i) SURF/SIFT features are detected (ii) then matched to
find coarse estimations of camera pose (iii) then a final step where a finer
estimate of the scene is found.

We aim to follow the following timeline:

\def\arraystretch{1.5}
\vspace{1em}
\begin{tabular}{|r|p{.82\columnwidth}|}
	\hline
	22nd March &
	Acquisition of small initial dataset using the Kinect. \newline
	Review and planning of specifics of the pipeline implementation.
	\\
	\hline
	2nd April &
	Feature extraction from acquired images using $\mathrm{vlfeat}$ and
	matching of image pairs or triples.
	\\
	\hline
	24th April &
	Coarse estimation of camera and feature pose and initial visualization
	using $\mathrm{PCL}$.
	\\
	\hline
	8th May &
	Finer estimation of feature pose via Bundle Adjustment using
	$\mathrm{ceres}$.
	\\
	\hline
	22nd May &
	Implementation of alternate scene registration methods. Evaluation of
	results.
	\\
	\hline
\end{tabular}
\vspace{1em}

A challenge is the evaluation of various scene registration methods, including
2D-2D, 3D-3D and 3D-2D point registration. Furthermore a suitable global
optimizer is to be found, which incorporates sensorâ€™s depth information as
prior.

The implementation will mainly be carried out using C++. Various libraries will
be used, such as vlfeat (feature detection),  PnP solvers (scene registration),
and ceres (bundle adjustment).

\section{Outcomes and Demonstration}

The project should yield a 3D reconstruction of a room environment. This
procedure can be verified by applying to an unknown scene. A visualization of
the result will be shown using the Point Cloud Library (PCL) or Meshlab, with
comparisons to a video feed.
